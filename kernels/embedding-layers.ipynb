In this lesson, I'll show how to implement a model with embedding layers using the `tf.keras` API. Embeddings are a technique that enable deep neural nets to work with **sparse categorical variables**.\n\n# Sparse Categorical Variables\n\nBy this I mean a categorical variable with lots of possible values (high *cardinality*), with a small number of them (often just 1) present in any given observation. One good example is words. There are hundreds of thousands of them in the English language, but a single tweet might only have a dozen. Word embeddings are a crucial technique for applying deep learning to natural language. But other examples abound.\n\nFor example, [this dataset of LA county restaurant inspections](https://www.kaggle.com/meganrisdal/la-county-restaurant-inspections-and-violations) has several sparse categorical variables, including:\n- `employee_id`: which of the health department's employees performed this inspection? (~250 distinct values)\n- `facility_zip`: what zip code is the restaurant located in? (~3,000 distinct values)\n- `owner_name`: who owns the restaurant? (~35,000 distinct values)\n\nAn embedding layer would be a good idea for using any of these variables as inputs to a network.\n\nIn this lesson, I'll be using the [MovieLens dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset) as an example.\n\n# MovieLens\n\nThe MovieLens dataset consists of ratings assigned to movies by users.

A single input to our model is a vector of 165,237 numbers (of which we know that 165,235 will be zeros). The feature data for our whole dataset of 20 million rating instances will require a 2-d array of size 20,000,000 x 165,237, or about 3 **trillion** numbers. Good luck fitting that all into memory at once!\n\nAlso, doing training and inference on our model will be inefficient. To calculate the activations of our first hidden layer, we'll need to multiply our 165k inputs through about 21 million weights - but the vast, vast majority of those products will just be zero.\n\nOne-hot encoding is fine for categorical variables with a small number of possible values, like `{Red, Yellow, Green}`, or `{Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday}`. But it's not so great in cases like our movie recommendation problem, where variables have tens or hundreds of thousands of possible values.\n\n## Good idea: Embedding layers\n\nIn short, an **embedding layer** maps each element in a set of discrete things (like words, users, or movies) to a dense vector of real numbers (its **embedding**). \n\n> **Aside:** A key implementation detail is that embedding layers take as input the *index* of the entity being embedded (i.e. we can give it our userIds and movieIds as input). You can think of it as a sort of 'lookup table'. This is much more efficient than taking a one-hot vector and doing a huge matrix multiplication!\n\nAs an example, if we learn embeddings of size 8 for movies, the embedding for *Legally Blonde* (index=4352) might look like:\n\n$$[ 1.624, -0.612, -0.528, -1.073,  0.865, -2.302,  1.745, -0.761]$$\n\n**Where do these come from?** We initialize an embedding for each user and movie using random noise, then we train them as part of the process of training the overall rating-prediction model. \n\n**What do they mean?** An object's embedding, if it's any good, should capture some useful latent properties of that object. But the key word here is *latent* AKA hidden. It's up to the model to discover whatever properties of the entities are useful for the prediction task, and encode them in the embedding space. Sound mysterious? In later lessons I'll show some techniques for interpreting learned embeddings, such as visualizing them with the t-SNE algorithm."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fa70585e512ee6e095d5309034d344c74fb7d533"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Implementing it\n\nI want my model to look something like this:\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Z1eVQu9.png)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0cc9049b23066e18046fca655b39ad601158af85"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A key thing to note is that this network is not simply a stack of layers from input to output.
