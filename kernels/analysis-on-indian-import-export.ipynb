No matter, how they are sent to the country. They can be shipped, sent it by e-mail, or even hand carried in personal luggage on a plane. A country importing more than it’s export, runs a **trade deficit**. Whereas, a country importing less than it’s exports, create a **trade surplus**.\n\n**Exporting** means goods and services which are produced in one country are purchased in another country. It is produced domestically and sold to someone in a foreign country. Most countries want to increase their exports as it increases the GDP of the country.\n\nIn India At the level of Central Government it is administered by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.\n\nPrior to the 1991 economic liberalisation,India was a closed economy due to the average tariffs exceeding 200 percent and the extensive quantitative restrictions on imports. Foreign investment was strictly restricted to only allow Indian ownership of businesses. Since the liberalisation, India's economy has improved mainly due to increased foreign trade\n\n[More on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-import-and-export)\n[More on Wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_trade_of_India)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Loading Libraries**\n\nwe will import libraries for data processing and preparing charts "},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# charts\nimport seaborn as sns \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport squarify #TreeMap\n\n# import graph objects as \"go\"\n\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\n\n%matplotlib inline\n\n#ignore warning \nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Data Loading**\n\nwe need to load two files one for import and other for export .
