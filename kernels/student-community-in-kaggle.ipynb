bioengineering graduate that has just started learning data science, I am surprised to say that I was not introduced to machine learning during my college years.

Now that I can handle my own data with python libraries, I am wondering, since research is data-driven decision making, was it me who didn't search enough to learn powerful data analysis and prediction tools or there really was a sudden boom of data science in general and especially in biomedical research.\n\nI kept having these thoughts until I came across an article entitled[ Deep Learning in the Biomedical Applications: Recent and Future Status [1]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332391435_Deep_Learning_in_the_Biomedical_Applications_Recent_and_Future_Status).

Subsequently, the number of research publications **recorded an exponential growth during the last three years**, which makes machine and deep learning, suddenly, compulsory tools in biomedical research.\n\n\n\nI started this story by telling my own story. I will follow up focusing on the student community in kaggle to understand this sudden boom of data science and its impact on students, universities and companies. Also, to show how great and useful it would be to graduate with machine and deep learning skills.\n\n### Abstract\n***\nWe will analyze in this study the 2019 kaggle survey data.

I started taking data science online courses this year at the age of 25. Seeing all these 18 and 19 years old students here generates a bit of envy because I would have liked to be in their position. Obviously, data science was there 7 years ago when I started college, this field was existing for decades and people in the industry were applying statistics and data analytics to their data, but due to the unavailability of processing power, its application was limited. \n\nThus, the sudden boom of data science happened just a couple of years ago [[2]](https://medium.com/@vishargshah/why-the-sudden-boom-of-data-science-56315e141f32), high configured CPU and GPU nowadays made the process of huge data in small time, (big thanks to Kaggle for the weekly 30 hours GPU use:) ).\n\nThat being said, as a bioengineering graduate, I took programming and statistics classes but our university didn't happen to offer machine learning courses, which they included last year in the academic curriculum. The new graduates will have the necessary tools to deal with biomedical data to classify different types of cancers or predict the response of a specific cancer to a therapy. This kind of research takes sometimes decades and hopefully [with machine and deep learning the drug discovery process will be reduced [3]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0191-0).\n\nSo we continue our analysis, we found that the students 18-24 years old are the most represented age range in the kaggle 2019 survey. \n\nWas it always the case in the previous years? Let's compare the students participation in 2019 with the 2017 and 2018 surveys and see how the interest of the students changed over time."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3- The increasing interest of students in data science\n***\n> ### 3.1 Students participation in kaggle surveys\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(15,5))\nplt.title('AGE OF STUDENT RESPONDENTS', weight='bold', fontsize=18)\nst7['New age'].value_counts().plot(color='deeppink',animated=True, linewidth=4,\n         marker='h', markerfacecolor='deeppink', markeredgewidth=2,\n         markersize=7, markevery=3)\nst8['Q2'].value_counts().plot(color='deepskyblue', linewidth=4,\n         marker='d', markerfacecolor='lightgreen', markeredgewidth=2,\n         markersize=7, markevery=3)\nst9['Q1'].value_counts().plot(color='tan', linewidth=4,\n         marker='d', markerfacecolor='lightgreen', markeredgewidth=2,\n         markersize=7, markevery=3)\nlegend_properties = {'weight':'bold','size': 20}\nplt.legend(['Survey 2017','Survey 2018','Survey 2019'],loc='right', prop=legend_properties)\nplt.xlabel('Age intervals', weight='bold', fontsize=15)\nplt.xticks(fontsize=15, weight='bold')\nplt.yticks(fontsize=15, weight='bold')\nplt.ylabel('Respondents', weight='bold', fontsize=15)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":" I already mentioned the sudden boom of data science, and this graph represents this sudden increase in interest in data science among students from  **400** respondents in **2017** to **2000** respondents in **2018**.

Such software generally offers a suite of the kinds of analysis and visualization that are typically required for the data that it handles. However, these packages are relatively limited and inflexible. If we need, for example, our data presented in a slightly different format that better matches the specific needs of our research project, we can't because we lack the programming skills to present the data the way we want.

Those students that started learning ML since college will graduate with 4 or 5 years of coding experience under their belt. \n \n Combining machine learning with their domain knowledge would make them very competitive in the job market. Personally, I find that being able to apply machine learning to my area of expertise, biomedical research, is a blessing. Building models, testing and updating them is entertaining, besides the fact that it makes you less frustrated with the failed experiments since it helps you save a lot of research time and cost thanks to the predictive power of machine and deep learning.\n\nIn relation to the above, companies will have a pool of knowledgeable graduates able to meet their acute business needs to improve their sales, marketing, research, and production. But are those companies ready to receive these talented students? The answer we ended up with is YES. Many companies, even small **start-ups begun establishing ML methods into production** [[8]](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/the-economics-of-artificial-intelligence). However, there is a difference in the size of investment made by these companies. While, big companies tend to spend more than >100,000 USD in cloud computing, start-ups are mostly using it for free.\n\nThe increase in the interest of students in data science is correlated with the **increase in demand for data scientists** [[6]](https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/feature/Demand-for-data-scientists-is-booming-and-will-increase). I have mentioned several times in this study how great it would be to graduate with coding skills along with your domain knowledge, because machine learning now is applicable in almost every industry, I gave some examples of the healthcare industry and how machine learning can help scientists reduce the process of drug discovery. In the near future, we will be hearing of **many new cures to cancers thanks to machine and deep learning** [[3]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0191-0). \n\nFinally, I would like to say that machine learning and artificial intelligence caught me by surprise. Before I graduated, deep learning wasn't applied in biomedical research and now, 4 years later, it's all what researchers are talking about. Intuitively, it feels like technology is progressing faster than ever and our job is to speed up our adoption to it. Technological evolution led to the [redefinition of the word literacy to digital literacy [12]](https://medium.com/literate-schools/redefining-literacy-in-the-21st-century-139894b14fd4), from the ability to read and write to the ability to use information and communication technologies. Is this fast technological progress leading us to an era where all our decisions are made thanks to machine and deep learning's prediction power? **an era of artificial intelligence literacy?**\n\nIt's an interesting and scary question! The answer is not clear but the fast evolution of AI might surprise us at any moment. Therefore, the best thing to do is to speed up our adoption to artificial intelligence, and do you know who does that the best? **The student community in Kaggle :)**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# References\n***\n\n[1] Deep Learning in the Biomedical Applications: Recent and Future Status in Applied Sciences 9(8):1526 · April 2019 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332391435/figure/fig1/AS:747054439612416@1555123066054/Distribution-of-published-papers-involving-deep-learning-in-biomedical-applications-The.ppm\n\n[2] Why the sudden boom of Data Science?
