Since BERT creates very large embeddings that will not fit into memory the idea is to use only the first 10 non-stop words from every text to see if it is enough to detect spam.\n\n[This excellent tutorial](http://jalammar.github.io/a-visual-guide-to-using-bert-for-the-first-time/) was followed to get BERT running\n\nInstalling HuggingFaces transformers package"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install transformers","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import re\nimport string\nimport torch\nimport transformers\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom sklearn.manifold import TSNE\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, roc_auc_score\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/sms-spam-collection-dataset/spam.csv\", encoding='latin-1')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data cleaning and feature engineering\n\nWe can discard the unnamed columns and replace \"ham\" with 0 and \"spam\" with 1\n\nTwo new features are engineered:\n- `num_words` -> Indicates the number of words in the message\n- `message_len` -> The length of the message"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.drop([\"Unnamed: 2\", \"Unnamed: 3\", \"Unnamed: 4\"], inplace=True, axis=1)\n\n#Adding new features\ndf[\"num_words\"] = df[\"v2\"].apply(lambda s: len(re.findall(r'\\w+', s))) # Count the number of words in the message\ndf[\"message_len\"] = df[\"v2\"].apply(len) # get the length of the text message\n\ndf[\"v1\"].replace({\"ham\": 0, \"spam\":1}, inplace=True)\n\ndf.rename({\"v1\": \"is_spam\", \"v2\": \"message\"},axis=1, inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"When cleaning the sentences punctuation is removed as well as english stopwords.

You can try embedding a larger number of words, maybe add n-grams to the messages as well and create an embedding for them. You can also tune the hyper-parameters of the random forest or use any other classification model you like!\n\nHope this helps :)"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
