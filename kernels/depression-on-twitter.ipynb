You may wonder why we are doing this, for these reasons:\n1. there are more and more depressions happening in our socialty\n2. twitter had provided it's api for developer to access it's data before 2006\n\nWhat did others do?\n1. better than 0.9 accuracy\n\nWhat will we do after catching up with the achievements of others?\n1. get more data on Twitter, and study the method\n2. make some interesting exploration. such as detect in tweet time as [this](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/a-machine-learning-approach-for-detection-of-depression-and-mental-illness-in-twitter-3f3a32a4df60) said and ating behaviour\n3. try more models, and study the differences and principles\n4. trace twitts of a user, use lstm model and Markov chain\n5. explore the ating behaviour"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset\n\nWe use the [sentiment140 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140). It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the twitter api. The tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 4 = positive) and they can be used to detect sentiment.\n\nIt contains the following 6 fields:\n\n1. target: the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)\n2. ids: The id of the tweet ( 2087)\n3. date: the date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)\n4. flag: The query (lyx).
