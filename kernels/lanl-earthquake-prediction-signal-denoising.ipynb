We will look at <a href='#1'>Wavelet Denoising with High-Pass Filters</a> and <a href='#1'>Average Smoothing</a>. The first method is used to remove the artificial impulse and the latter one is used to remove general noise.\n\n<center><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/hBPv3fh.png\" width=\"750px\"></center>\n\nThe main problem in the specific case of seismic signals is the fact that the signal we measure with a seismograph is not an accurate representation of the actual underground seismic signal we are trying to uncover. **In seismology, we (the people trying to measure the seismic signals) artificially generate signals called impulse signals. These impulse signals interact with the Earth's actual seismic signal (which is what we need) to produce the final signal which our seismograph picks up** (this same process takes place in the laboratory simulation of an earthquake). So, the real challenge is to uncover the actual signal from mixed seismogram (which is a combination of the Earth's impulse signal and the artificial impulse signal).\n\nThis actual underlying signal would be a better predictor of earthquake timing than the original raw signal, because it represents the actual seismic activity."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<center><img src=\"https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4033b6af35e7154e6b497adf0d93c2d9-c\" width=\"300px\"></center>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The third signal from the right is what we have (with artificial impulse) and the last signal from the right is what we're looking for (without the artificial impulse)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Acknowledgements\nI would like to thank Jack for [his kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/jackvial/dwt-signal-denoising) and Theo for [his kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/theoviel/fast-fourier-transform-denoising) (both on denoising)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Import necessary libraries"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport gc\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.fft import *\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport pywt \nfrom statsmodels.robust import mad\nimport scipy\nfrom scipy import signal\nfrom scipy.signal import butter, deconvolve\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Specify size of seismic signal segements and rate of sampling for high-pass filter"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"SIGNAL_LEN = 150000\nSAMPLE_RATE = 4000","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Read data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"seismic_signals = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv', dtype={'acoustic_data': np.int16, 'time_to_failure': np.float32})","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Extract seismic data and targets and delete the original dataframe"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"acoustic_data = seismic_signals.acoustic_data\ntime_to_failure = seismic_signals.time_to_failure\ndata_len = len(seismic_signals)\ndel seismic_signals\ngc.collect()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Cut out segments of size 150k from the signal"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"signals = []\ntargets = []\n\nfor i in range(data_len//SIGNAL_LEN):\n    min_lim = SIGNAL_LEN * i\n    max_lim = min([SIGNAL_LEN * (i + 1), data_len])\n    \n    signals.append(list(acoustic_data[min_lim : max_lim]))\n    targets.append(time_to_failure[max_lim])\n    \ndel acoustic_data\ndel time_to_failure\ngc.collect()\n    \nsignals = np.array(signals)\ntargets = np.array(targets)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### The mean absolute deviation\nThis calculates the mean of the absolute values of the deviations of the individual numbers in the time series from the mean of the time series.
