Processing the Images"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Our CNN model can only work with numbers. What we have are Image URLs and their categorical labels. We will deal with the labels later. Now we need to convert the images into something the CNN can work with.\n\nAs we have seen earlier, the images are colored. An image is just a matrix of pixels. Every pixel in a colored image consists of three-dimensional information (amount of red, green, and blue respectively). The pixels of grayscale (black and white) images however only need one-dimensional data. It varies from 0 to 255. The lower corresponds to absolute white and the upper end corrsponds to absolute black. Everything in between can represent any shade of grayscale possible. \n\nWe will urlib to download the images from the URLs, use numpy to convert the images into nice clean ndarrays. We will use OpenCV to read those ndarrays in color form (The order in Open CV is Blue-Green-Red). We will convert it to another format 'HSV' where we can create a mask that will detect those red rectangles.\n\nUsing OpenCV, we can either read the ndarray directly in grayscale format or convert the BGR format to grayscale. \n\nThen we will fetch the pixel coordinates of the corners of the detected rectangles, and using them crop the grayscale versions.We also need uniformity in our data. The original images have different shapes. So, we will reshape every cropped grayscale image into 100x100 pixels.\n\nEvery OpenCV image is stored as array data. So all these ndarrays can be flattened into a single dimensional array of length 10000x1 (we can reshape arrays into any desirable dimensions as long as the total number of elements in the original array and the transformed array remain the same.\n\nNote that reshaping images on OpenCV though is different since there loss of information is not an issue. We can compromise with the image resoution there.\n\nAlso note that we are only using OpenCV to read and edit images. We will use Pyplot to view the images, and that requies RGB(Red-Green-Blue) format.
