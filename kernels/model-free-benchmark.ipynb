When the rushing team is in their own half there is the possibility of them rushing all 100 yards of the field.

This is reflected by the cdf maxing out at yard-50 and then being 1's for the rest of the yards. \n\nWe can use these two different distributions and just apply them to all of the plays and it turns out this is a decent benchmark.\n\nWe can extend this even further by knowing that when the ball is in the opponents half the yard line determines the maximum number of yards the rushing team can travel.
